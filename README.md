# Baltimore City Casino Local Impact Grants
Analysis for and documentation of Baltimore City Casino Local Impact Grant funding for fiscal management and performance

## Getting Started

This repository serves to provide data and other information about the Casino Local Impact Grant funding distributed from the City of Baltimore. We aim to conduct analysis and provide visualizations that demonstrate:

 - Funding distribution with respect to city agency, type of programming, grant goals, and fiscal year

 - Performance measures that consider the timeliness of funds spent and city agencies’ accountability to their projects

 - Total spending and spending trends for these grants and how they may impact distribution and outcomes

 - Any other analysis and requests for additional data that can better inform the city in how they distribute and monitor funding and better inform the public on the status of the Casino Local Impact Grant funded programs
 
 ## Background
 
Based on the state enabling legislation, ((2012 Special Session 2, SB 1), the City of Baltimore started receiving “Local Impact Funds” derived from the revenues of local Casino operations from Horseshoe Casino, Live Casino & Hotel, and MGM National Harbor in fiscal year 2015. These funds are to be used for improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding the Horseshoe Casino including Barre Circle, Carroll-Camden Industrial Area, Cherry Hill, Federal Hill, Lakeland, Mount Winans, Otterbein, Pigtown, Ridgely’s Delight, Riverside, South Baltimore Neighborhood, Sharp-Leadenhall, Saint Paul, and Westport.

The programming initiatives from these grants should last for at least one fiscal year and fall under one of the grant’s eight targeted initiatives:

 - Transportation Connectivity
 - Environmental Sustainability
 - Safety
 - Community Development & Revitalization
 - Economic Growth
 - Education
 - Health & Wellness
 - Quality of Life

The Local Development Council (LDC), along with the Planning Department, initially served as a steering committee for the master planning and distribution process, and in 2016, the South Baltimore Gateway Partnership was formed to help manage a significant portion of these funds. The funding listed in this dataset is currently managed through the Baltimore City Mayor’s Office.
